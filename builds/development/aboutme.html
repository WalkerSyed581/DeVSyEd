				<h2>Intro</h2>
					<p>Hi There&#33; Visitor of My Site&#33;&#33; The site you have landed upon belongs to <strong>Syed Sajeel Hassan</strong> and is kinda like a mostly personal and a <em>portfolio site</em> mashed together to form what you see before your eyes. I am from the Northern Province of <em>Pakistan</em> and I am &#40;or soon to become&#41; a <strong>Front&#45;End Web Developer</strong>. On this website you will learn about nobody else but Me and Only ME. Because thatâ€™s what this site is all about as you may have guessed from the title. I talk about my skills in web development and about personal things as well. You can also Hire Me for your Web Project.</p>

			<h2>My Life</h2>
				<section>
					<h3>Overview of My Existence</h3>
					<p>Okay just to be clear I am not gonna talk about how I came to be &#40;If that is what you thought&#41;. I&#44; Syed Sajeel Hassan&#44; am an 18 year old boy living in the Northern Province of Pakistan and in a city called D.I.Khan &#40;The full name is a mouthful&#41;. I just finished my 2nd year of college. My life has been pretty normal without much troubles and I am kinda like what you may call an introvert to some extent.</p>
						
					<p>My childhood was great but not much outings as I belong to a mediocre family. The school years were &#39;normal&#39;. I am what you may call an accomplished child as far as academics are concerned because I have had straight A&#43;&#39;s my entire academic career. </p>
						
					<p>I LOVE web development, and it&#39;s my passion. Weird right, a guy who has gone through all the torture of Physics&#44; Chemistry and Calculus and did well in all of them has suddenly stumbled upon and loves nothing other but web development but that is the way I am. I also love astronomy and studying about the Heavens and knowing about its vastness and beauty. And last but not the least I do not like the place and province I live in. I guess you&#39;d be the same if in my place.</p>

				    <h3>Personality</h3>
					<p> Okay let me talk about the thing &#40;personality&#41; that comes into being from the three &#39;<i>Doshas</i>&#39; according to Indian mystics. As I mentioned I am kinda like an <strong>introvert</strong> but I can also be quite social provided I am in the right context and environment. I hope i do not seem to you like a machine which only works in society when given the right fuel. </p>
					 
					<p>Anyways I am a Metalhead as far as music is concerned. I also like other genres but this is the main one. I am also a nerd who likes knowing about all sorts of stuff&#44;  especially the one which will help me through this weird thing we call life. I am not a big fan of being angry and I like to keep a cool and calm head. I tend to think about stuff logically but I am also kind of flexible guy when I am sure it is all right to be flexible.</p>
					 
				    <p>I guess that is enough about a weirdo like me who has only lived 18 years and is talking about personality and stuff like an old man. I hope you don&#39;t doubt me being 18 from all this talk. </p>
