					<p>It is kinda like a mostly personal and a <em>portfolio site</em> mashed together to form what you see before your eyes.I am from the Northern Province of <em>Pakistan</em> and I am &#40;or soon to become&#41; a <strong>Front&#45;End Web Developer</strong>. On this website you will learn about me as a Web Developer and a fellow human. Because thatâ€™s what this site is all about as you may have guessed from the title. I talk about my skills in web development and about personal things as well. You can also <a href="hireme.html" title="Hire Me as a Web Developer">Hire Me</a> for your Web Project.</p>

					<h3>Bio Overview</h3>
					<p>Okay just to be clear I am not gonna talk about how I came to be &#40;If that is what you thought&#41;. I&#44; Syed Sajeel Hassan&#44; am an 18 year old boy living in the Northern Province of Pakistan and in a city called <abbr title="Dera Ismail Khan">D.I.Khan</abbr> &#40;The full name is a mouthful&#41;. I am an introvert which has been an advantage to some extent.</p>

											<section id="academics">
							<h4>Academics</h4>
							<p> I just finished my 2<sup>nd</sup> year of college. I am what you may call an accomplished child as far as academics are concerned because I have had straight A&#43;&#39;s my entire academic career. I also achieved 7<sup>th</sup> Position in the city in 2<sup>nd</sup> Year of College. At the same time i came 2<sup>nd</sup> in my own category of subjects.</p>

							<h4>Web Development</h4>
							<p>I LOVE web development, and it&#39;s my passion. Weird right, a guy who has gone through all the torture of Physics&#44; Chemistry and Calculus and did well in all of them has suddenly stumbled upon and loves nothing other but web development. But it is true and i am pursuing this field as a career. <a href="mypassion.html" title="Web Development as a passoin">Learn more about why i like it so much</a>. And last but not the least I do not like the place and province I live in. I guess you&#39;d be the same if in my place. One of the main reason why i want to become a freelancer is to get outta here.</p>

					<section id="personality">
				    <h3>Personality</h3>
					<p> Okay let me talk about the thing &#40;personality&#41; that comes into being from the three &#39;<i>Doshas</i>&#39; according to Indian mystics. Human beings are complex as you may know and their are lots of aspects of one's perosnality but here i will mention the major ones in me. </p>
						<h4>Introversion</h4>
						<p>As I mentioned I am kinda like an <strong>introvert</strong> but I don't mind being in any social place or social gathering. I just tend to remain at home most of the time. But mind you, that is not always the case. As a side effect of introversion i am also not much talkative unless the topic is of my interest. I am strongly against talking as much as you can for no reason.</p>
					
						<h4>Likes and Dislikes</h4>
						<p>Anyways I am a Metalhead as far as music is concerned. I also like other genres but this is the main one. I am also a nerd who likes knowing about all sorts of stuff&#44;  especially the one which will help me through this weird thing we call life. And most importantly <a href="otakustuff.html" title="Read about my liking of anime">i love Anime</a>. I am not a big fan of being angry and I like to keep a cool and calm head. I tend to think about stuff logically but I am also kind of flexible guy when I am sure it is all right to be flexible.</p>
