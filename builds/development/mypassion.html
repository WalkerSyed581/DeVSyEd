					<p>It is kinda like a mostly personal and a <em>portfolio site</em> mashed together to form what you see before your eyes.I am from the Northern Province of <em>Pakistan</em> and I am &#40;or soon to become&#41; a <strong>Front&#45;End Web Developer</strong>. On this website you will learn about nobody else but Me and Only ME. Because that’s what this site is all about as you may have guessed from the title. I talk about my skills in web development and about personal things as well. You can also <a href="hireme.html">Hire Me</a> for your Web Project.</p>

						<h2>My Passion</h2>
						<p><strong>Passion</strong>&#33;&#33;Man that is such a heavy yet beautiful word. Enlighten me if you know why something becomes your passion but mine is to do Web Development. I love doing it. I won’t say &#39;&#39;more than anything&#39;&#39; because there are some other things as well &#42;wink&#42; &#42;wink&#42;. Web Development is the reason why I am currently making this site so as to pursue this field as a career.</p>
						<p>This is the field for which I&#44; after finishing my 2nd year in college&#44; am not taking admission in a university so that I can chase my dream job and hopefully I soon will be successful if God wills. I am a Freelance Web Developer and I love it. One of the main reason I love it is because of the freedom I have in this field and importantly I can make my imagination go wild in this field along with other more important reasons as well.</p>

						<h3>Web Development</h3> 
						<p>Web Development is a field I was introduced to by my Uncle when I was 16 or so. I was told by my cousin that this field can get me a long way in life and I was intrigued. Once I started learning <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language"  class="initialism">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets"  class="initialism">CSS</abbr>, I was like Woah&#33;&#33; This is the most fun and best thing I have ever done. It was like a new world was opened in front of me. I wanted to learn more of it&#44; things like JavaScript&#44; but could not at that time because of school and I had to go to college the next year so I stopped.</p>

						<p>I resumed learning web development on <time datetime="2017-05-12">12th May 2017</time> and have loved the few months journey up to this point. Web Development to a large and Programming to a small extent are the sort of things to me which make you feel like you have actually done something instead of memorizing and writing on paper.</p>

						<h3>Why I like It&#63;</h3>
						<p>Now it could have been the time of me telling you stories behind me liking this field which I so can&#39;t right now, so I will leave you with this list of reasons&#58; </p>
						<ul>
							<li>The control and freedom it provides to you for making anything you want and have the power to spread it to the whole world is just amazing.</li>
							<li>The learning process is very enjoyable and the joy you feel when you practice a new language or a feature and you get it right is beyond the constraint of words.</li>
							<li>The great thing about this field is that the experts and pros within it are willing to share their experience with the newbies so that anyone can learn it with an internet connection.</li>
							<li>Most importantly for me&#44; the uncertainty of the work makes it even more amazing and motivates you to work hard while plunging into its uncertain depths is an amazing experience because you have so much to learn and nothing much to lose at all.</li>
							<li>And of course being called a person who makes the World Wide Web&#44; which everyone uses day in and day out&#44; is also a pretty good feeling.</li>
