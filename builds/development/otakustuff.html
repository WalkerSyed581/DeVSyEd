					<h3>Anime</h3>
					<p>I know&#44; most of you are confused about what &#39;otaku&#39; means. It is a <em>Japanese</em> word which although actually means something else but in this context it means &#39;a person who loves watching anime a lot&#39;. I am one of those. Anime are Japanese animated series some of which are available in English Dubbed version as well. Most of them are English Subbed.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime" title="Read more about anime">Further reading about anime can be done on Wikiepdia.</a></p>
					<h4>Why So Good?</h4>
					<p>I recommend watching at least a few anime in your life because they are quite different from typical cartoons and are quite good at teaching life lessons and showing the harsh side of life. Some of them strike at the core of being human and leave you quite shaken up about yourself and what you are doing with life and all that serious stuff. I guess it&#39;s getting kinda serious and cramped up over here. Let us ease the atmosphere a bit.</p>

					<section id="whyLikeAnime">
					<h3>Why I Like Anime&#63;</h3>
					<p>Okay I won&#39;t let the atmosphere get serious around here and go straight to the point. I like anime because I like them&#33;&#33; WOW&#33; I guess that was less serious, don&#33;t you think. To be honest it is true to some extent but I have quite a few reasons as well&#58;</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Firstly&#44; anime feels a lot more real compared to Movies and TV Shows because the characters are not acting at all. It is what they are going through.</li>
						<li>Most of the popular anime have lots and lots of lessons for your life and how you go about certain aspects of it.</li>
						<li>Anime characters are really diverse compared to the typical hero&#92;villain or love triangle typical characters in most things on TV. </li>
						<li>More importantly there are lots and lots of genre of anime. And I do mean lots if you get what I mean.</li>
						<li>Some of the anime even prepare you for the situations that can be upcoming in your life or are possible in the life you are going through which is a great learning experience.</li>
						<li>Last but not the least&#44; you will get to know one of the most complex language of our era that is Japanese. And watching more anime will make you wanna learn that.</li>
